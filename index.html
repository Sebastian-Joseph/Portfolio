            <!-- Replace the below paragraph with info about yourself -->
            <p>
              As a computer science student at Kean University, I am deeply passionate about app development. 
              I have always been driven by the love of problem-solving and creativity, which led me to start creating programs and apps that solve everyday issues faced by people around me. 
              My interest in computer science began in high school, where I was fortunate enough to have access to a plethora of computer science courses. 
              During this time, I learned programming languages such as Java, Python, HTML/CSS and Javascript and gained valuable experience in software development.
              To further enhance my skills, I took a summer course at Norwich University, where I was able to delve deeper into computer science and learn more about cyber security. 
              This experience allowed me to gain a better understanding of app development and how to create programs that meet user needs.
              In addition to my academic pursuits, I am also dedicated to giving back to my community. 
              Together with a group of like-minded individuals, I co-founded a volunteer organization aimed at teaching young children programming skills. 
              Through this organization, we have taught HTML/CSS to children in our community, empowering them with valuable skills that will serve them well in the future.
              My experience in the food and customer service industry has also been instrumental in developing my interpersonal and communication skills. 
              I have learned the importance of teamwork, collaboration, and effective communication, all of which are essential qualities for success in any field.
              Overall, my passion for app development, coupled with my diverse experiences and skill set, has prepared me well for a career in software engineering. 
              I am excited to see where this journey takes me and look forward to making a positive impact in the world through my work.
